# Season projects  

# Minimal definition to create submodule:
## int SEASON*
## str URL*
## str BRANCH 
## IN THIS ORDER!!!
## season, url are required, as they allow to derive the name and the path of the submodule, get the owner and the repo in GitHub Action
## season int will be transformed in season_name "S01",...,"S99" :)
## branch will default to 'main' if omitted

## Submodule name and path are automatically determined and follow the following patterns:
## submodule_name : parent_org-season_name-repo_name
### parent_org=d4g, org4g, ... (this prefix helps in Vs Code to easier identify projetcs in Source Control)
## submodule_path : /projects/season_name/submodule_name
 
# Test season projects

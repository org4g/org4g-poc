# SEASON PROJECTS
# TODO: See with Orga/Tech team to automate this file based on Slack, Notion or Web Site
# We could imagine some scraping if necessary

# Minimal definition to create submodule:
## int SEASON*
## str URL*
## str BRANCH 

## season, url are required, as they allow to derive the name and the path of the submodule, get the owner and the repo in GitHub Action
## season int will be transformed in 
## season_name "S01",...,"S99" 
## branch will default to 'main' if omitted (TODO, specific branch????)

## Submodule name and path are automatically determined and follow the following patterns:
## org_name=d4g, org4g, ... (this prefix helps in Vs Code to easier identify projetcs in Source Control)
## repo_name: derived for URL
## owner_name: derived for URL
## submodule_name : org_name-season_name-repo_name
## submodule_path : /projects/submodule_name
 
# Test season projects
# gaudinnicolas32/project-for-good
[test project]
  season: 0
  url: https://github.com/gaudinnicolas32/project-for-good.git
  branch: main 
  # TODO question on branch???

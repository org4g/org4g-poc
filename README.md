"Org4g" is a fake organisation, owned by a personal GithHub account.

This is a proof of concept, not a fully working organisation, neither repo.

This repo is made public for demo and test purposes between private members of Org4g organisation.




# Org4g PoC

:wave: to members of Org4g Organization.


## :bulb: IDEA BEHIND THIS...

Lets think of "poc", also as "Point of Contact" in this scenario.

This project (or its clone in other organization) aims at becoming the Entrypoint for Volunteers and Project Owners of Org4g projects hosted on GitHub (and GitLab? TODO).

It aims at helping cross collaboration on Org4g projects, in onboarding :rocket: and coding :wink: phase.
The goal is also to connect to external tools such as Slack and Notion.

3 main workflows :recycle: exist:

 :ballot_box_with_check: **Volunteers** (People willing to collaborate on Org4g's boosted projects)

 :ballot_box_with_check: **Owners** (People owning a project that has been accepted as part of an Org4g's season )  

 ( and :heavy_check_mark: **Admin**, for members of Org4g organization)
